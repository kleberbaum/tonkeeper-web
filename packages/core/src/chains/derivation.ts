/**
 * Canonical BIP-44 derivation paths per chain. TON uses SLIP-0044 coin type
 * 607 with a hardened account index and no terminal change/index leaf (its
 * `walletContract()` already encodes the wallet version + workchain). EVM,
 * BTC and TRON follow the standard BIP-44 layout (m / purpose' / coin' /
 * account' / change / index). Solana uses the ed25519-on-Sol layout
 * (account-only, all-hardened, no change/index).
 *
 * **Scope warning:** the *path* shape is shared by every chain, but the
 * *derivation function* is curve-specific. Only TON's `m/44'/607'/0'` path
 * is wired through `deriveED25519Path` (ed25519) in Phase 1. EVM and BTC
 * need secp256k1, Solana needs ed25519-with-SLIP-0010, and TRON's legacy
 * code already uses its own ethers.js HD walk (see
 * `service/walletService.ts:tonMnemonicToTronMnemonic`, intentionally
 * untouched in Phase 1). When those land, they will *consume* this map
 * but go through their own derivation helpers.
